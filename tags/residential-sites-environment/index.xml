      <description>This study examines elders’ preferences for residential site environments from their perceptions and evaluations. Unlike most earlier works on environments for elders, the study focuses on residential sites in a rural Asian context, with a mixed-methodology based on the extent of Person-Environment (P–E) fit. This will help to understand and identify the preferences of residential site environmental characteristics in a rural context.

      <description>An awareness of uncorrelated and correlated results between in silico and in vitro studies from the identification of enzyme inhibitors. The urgency of the drug discovery against viral infection is raising after the emergence of 2019 new coronavirus epidemic in China. The traditional drug discovery requires years of operation. Therefore, the fast-track strategy has been proceeded by applying a computer-based approach. However, the correlation between this approach and its biological activity is a great concern.</description>

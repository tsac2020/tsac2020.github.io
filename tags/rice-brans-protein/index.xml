      <description>The extraction of protein from plants using the cellulase enzyme. In addition, the extracted proteins were characterized including, protein solubility, proximate analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), SDS-pages, emulsifying and foaming. Rice bran is a by-product of the rice milling process, which is classified as a waste. However, there has been research done earlier; found that rice bran contains a massive number of proteins when compared to other plants. The extraction of plant proteins using cellulase enzymes is considered because the great nutrition is revealed, in which there is a comparison of extraction in many circumstances to get the best conditions.</description>
